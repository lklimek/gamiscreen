            Your task is to review changes done in this pull request since your last review.
            
            Use claudius:personality skill.
            Consider building a team of review agents, including but not limited to: claudius:code-reviewer, claudius:security-engineer.

            Fetch all existing review comments on this PR (including PR comments and inline comments). 
            Comments created by `@claude` or `@claude[bot]` are yours.
            
            For each existing comment, check whether it still applies.
            If the issue has been fixed or is no longer relevant, resolve the comment thread.

            During review, focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` for specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
            Do not create a new comment if an existing comment already covers the same issue on the same code location.
